    "This notebook is based on the supporting material for topics covered in **Chapter 7 - Logical Agents** and **Chapter 8 - First-Order Logic** from the book *Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach.* You can consult and modify the code provided in logic.py and logic.ipynb for completing the assignment questions. The first 5 questions do NOT rely on the provided aima code so you can complete it just using basic Python. The next 5 questions require the use of the aima-code repository. \n",

    "You are welcome and actually it can be educational to look at the code at the aima-code repository as well as other code resources you can find on the web. However, make sure you understand any code that you incoporate. \n",

    "3. Propositional Logic (Expected) - recursive infix evaluator for propositional logic \n",
    "4. Propositional Logic (Expected) - usage of evaluator to evaluate some example logic expressions\n",
    "5. Propositional Logic (Advanced) - model checking for the prefix evaluator \n",
    "6. Proposigtional Logic(Basic) - simple KB using aima code with model checking and theorem proving \n",
    "7. First-Order Logic (Basic) - kinship domain using FolKB for the Simpsons \n",
    "8. First-Order Logic (Expected) - kinship domain using Prolog for the Simpsons\n",
    "9. First-Order Logic (Expected) - LegoWorld \n",
    "10.First-Order Logic (Advanced) - NLP for LegoWorld or webscraping a KB for music  \n",

For example 5+3 in prefix notation is written + 5 3 or 5 * 2 + 3 would be written + * 5 2 3 or + * 5 2 * 3 4 is equivalent to (5 * 2) + (3 * 4). "

The website https://www.songfacts.com/ contains a large variety of facts about music. Check the https://www.songfacts.com/categories link for some categories. Using selenium Python bindings https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/ access the webpage and scrape at least three categories. Your code should scrape the information from the pages and convert it into relationships and facts in first-order logic using the syntax of expressions in logic.ipynb. Once you build your knowledge-base then write 4 non-trivial queries that show-case the expressiveness of FOL. These queries should not be possible to be answered easily using the web interface i.e they should have some logical connectives, more than one possible answer etc. The translation of the song facts from the web page to FOL should NOT be done by hand but using the web scraping tool you develop. You can use multiple cells in your answer."
